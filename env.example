# Development Configuration
PORT=3002
WS_PORT=3003

# WebSocket URL for client connection
# Development: Local WebSocket server
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=ws://localhost:3003

# Production Examples (uncomment and modify for your deployment):

# Option 1: Render.com dual-service deployment
# Frontend service uses this to connect to WebSocket service
# NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=wss://your-app-websocket.onrender.com

# Option 2: Custom domain deployment
# NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=wss://ws.yourdomain.com

# Option 3: Same domain, different port
# NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=wss://yourdomain.com:8080

# NOTE: If NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL is not set, the client will try to auto-detect
# based on the current hostname (works for most Render deployments)
